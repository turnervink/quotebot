# Quotebot Terms of Service
This bot is provided as-is with no guarantees of quality, availability, or security. It is provided to you for free, for fun, and since I'm hosting it myself I reserve the right to take it offline or make it non-public at any time without prior notice.

If I find out you're using Quotebot for harmful things you won't be allowed to use it any more. This includes storing content quotes that I don't want to be responsible for storing.

Please feel free to get in touch if you notice any issues, or have ideas for improvements. I may not be able to get back to you quickly or at all, and I may not be able to implement fixes or features, but I do love to hear from people using stuff I've created!
